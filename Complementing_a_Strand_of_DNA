The Secondary and Tertiary Structures of DNA

Problem

In DNA strings, symbols 'A' and 'T' are complements of each other, as are 'C' and 'G'.
The reverse complement of a DNA string s is the string sc formed by reversing the symbols of s, then taking the complement of each symbol (e.g., the reverse complement of "GTCA" is "TGAC").
Given: A DNA string s of length at most 1000 bp.
Return: The reverse complement sc of s.

Sample Dataset
AAAACCCGGT

Sample Output
ACCGGGTTTT

Solution

DNA = "AAAACCCGGT"

Rev = DNA[::-1]
Rev

def Revcom(Rev):
    Rev_com = ""
    for i in Rev:
        if i == "T":
            Rev_com = Rev_com + "A"
        elif i == "A":
            Rev_com = Rev_com + "T"
        elif i == "C":
            Rev_com = Rev_com + "G"
        else:
            i == "G"
            Rev_com = Rev_com + "C"
        
    return Rev_com
