The Secondary and Tertiary Structures of DNA
Problem
In DNA strings, symbols 'A' and 'T' are complements of each other, as are 'C' and 'G'.
The reverse complement of a DNA string s s is the string sc s c formed by reversing the symbols of s s , then taking the complement of each symbol (e.g., the reverse complement of "GTCA" is "TGAC").
Given: A DNA string s s of length at most 1000 bp.
Return: The reverse complement sc s c of s s .
